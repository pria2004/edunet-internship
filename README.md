# PERSONAL FINANCE MANAGER WITH MERN TECHNOLOGY
The Expense management project is designed to create a platform where users can create, view, edit, and delete expense with real-time updates. The platform ensures that any changes made to any expense are instantly reflected across all reports. This project will provide you with hands-on experience in implementing user authentication, managing documents, and ensuring real-time collaboration using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
